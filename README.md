# Description

We invite participation in a workshop on Curriculum and Course Design for Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Education. The workshop is motivated by the rapid growth in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering and, therefore, the need for students with a strong multidisciplinary theoretical and experimental skillset. These students are the future engineers who will design, develop, and implement transformative autonomous technologies toward improving human health and welfare.

Recognizing the need for preparing highly-educated MRE professionals, many universities and colleges are adopting MRE as a distinct degree program. However, there is not a well-defined and unified framework for such programs, which can cause confusion and ambiguity among instructors and future employers. To overcome this challenge, the authors, with financial support from NSF, have been engaged in holding several workshops on the Future of Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Education. These workshops have brought together more than 150 faculty, students, and industry professionals in the MRE field to share broad success stories; to develop concept inventories for MRE curricula and courses; to identify thought leaders; to learn the recent trends in industry; and to develop a roadmap for MRE education.

Capitalizing on the outcomes of these efforts and based on the feedback from workshopsâ€™ participants, the proposed workshop is anticipated to achieve the following outcomes:

* Involve a broad range of colleges and universities
* Develop a unified set of courses for MRE curricula
* Prepare faculty to teach mechatronics and robotics courses through hands-on activities
* Further expand the community of MRE educators
